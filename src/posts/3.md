A single pixel's color is determined, roughly speaking, by a single byte, a
byte can represent 256 numbers by having 8 bits (2^8 since each bit is 1 or 0). 
Each number in RGB goes from 0 - 255
representing 256 digits. If we do R * G * B we get a unique color each time
depending on the value of each position. Thus, we can determine the maximum
amount of colors that can be generated as 256^3 (256 cubed) which comes out to
16,777,216 unique colors.
