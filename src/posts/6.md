Elephant seals and walruses are the only two seals larger than them. The pups
of a leopard seal are born 1.5 meters in size (5ft). 

They live mostly in the subantarctic islands and antarctica. 

They are the only
seals whose diet consist of warm blooded animals, feasting on penguins and
other seals. 

They also consume krill, fish and cephalopods. 

They lack teeth
like lions and other land predators, as such rely on dragging their prey into
the water trashing and tearing them apart for bite sized consumption. 

They can
speeds of around 40 km/h. 

Their only recognised predators are the orca.
