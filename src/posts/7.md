title: "Organizing your thoughts visually is called mindmapping"

There is a whole category of software utilities that allow you to do this with
two of my favorite apps being XMind and Minder. XMind doesn't seem to be FOSS
but Minder is and for that reason is my favorite. It allows you to create
highly customisable mindmaps that can even be exported so others can view them
in multiple formats whether as images, CSVs or Markup styled to list some.
